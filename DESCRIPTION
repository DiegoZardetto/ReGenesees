Title: R Evolved Generalized Software for Sampling Estimates and Errors
       in Surveys
Description: Design-Based and Model-Assisted analysis of complex sample surveys.
        Multistage, stratified, clustered, unequally weighted survey designs.
        Calibration of survey weights. Horvitz-Thompson and Calibration Estimators.
        Variance Estimation for nonlinear smooth estimators by Taylor-series
        linearization. Estimates, standard errors, confidence intervals and design
        effects for: Totals, Means, absolute and relative Frequency Distributions
        (marginal, conditional, and joint), Ratios, Shares and Ratios of Shares,
        Multiple Regression Coefficients, and Quantiles. Automated Linearization
        of user-defined Complex Estimators. Design Covariance and Correlation.
        Estimates and sampling errors of user-defined complex Measures of Change
        derived from two not necessarily independent samples. Estimates and sampling
        errors for subpopulations. Consistent trimming of calibration weights.
        Calibration on complex population parameters, e.g. multiple regression
        coefficients. Generalized Variance Functions (GVF) method for predicting
        variance estimates. Sample size requirements and power calculations.
