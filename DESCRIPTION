Title: R Evolved Generalized Software for Sampling Estimates and Errors
        in Surveys
Description: Design-Based and Model-Assisted analysis of complex sampling surveys.
        Multistage, stratified, clustered, unequally weighted survey designs.
        Horvitz-Thompson and Calibration Estimators. Variance Estimation for
        nonlinear smooth estimators by Taylor-series linearization. Estimates,
        standard errors, confidence intervals and design effects for: Totals,
        Means, absolute and relative Frequency Distributions (marginal, conditional
        and joint), Ratios, Shares and Ratios of Shares, Multiple Regression
        Coefficients and Quantiles. Automated Linearization of Complex Analytic
        Estimators. Design Covariance and Correlation. Estimates, standard errors,
        confidence intervals and design effects for user-defined analytic estimators.
        Estimates and sampling errors for subpopulations. Consistent trimming of
        calibration weights. Generalized Variance Functions (GVF) method for
        predicting variance estimates.
