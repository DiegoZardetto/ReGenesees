<a href="#regenesees-24" class="anchor"></a>ReGenesees 2.4</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>THIS IS A DEVELOPMENT VERSION AND IS NOT RELEASED YET!</p></li>
<li><p>Functions n.prop, prec.prop, n.mean, and prec.mean no longer
neglect finite population corrections (fpc). To factor in the fpc, you
need to specify the target population size by using the new (and still
optional) argument ‘N’. The new argument defaults to NULL, which would
again result in neglecting the fpc, as in previous versions of
ReGenesees.</p></li>
<li><p>The output of function UWE(), when calculated by domains
(i.e. argument ‘by’ is passed), has now a better behavior under
<em>subsetting by columns</em>. Note that this improvement does not have
any other visible effects (values and metadata are exactly the same as
before).</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
    <div id="regenesees-23" class="section level1">
<h1 class="page-header">
<a href="#regenesees-23" class="anchor"></a>ReGenesees 2.3</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>New functions n.prop, n.comp2prop, prec.prop, pow.comp2prop, and
mde.comp2prop. These functions estimate the minimum sample size required
to</p>
<p>(i) satisfy specific precision constraints in the estimation of
proportions and to (ii) attain specified levels of significance and
power in a statistical test that compares two proportions. The inverse
problems of finding, given a specified sample size, (iii) the expected
precision of the estimator of the proportion and (iv) the expected power
or (v) minimum detectable effect for the test that compares two
proportions are also addressed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New functions n.mean, n.comp2mean, prec.mean, pow.comp2mean, and
mde.comp2mean. These functions estimate the minimum sample size required
to (i) satisfy specific precision constraints in the estimation of means
and to (ii) attain specified levels of significance and power in
statistical test that compares two means. The inverse problems of
finding, given a specified sample size,</p>
<p>(iii) the expected precision of the estimator of the mean and (iv)
the expected power or (v) minimum detectable effect for the test that
compares two means are also addressed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>New function get.linvar. This function computes the linearized
variable(s) of a Complex Estimator in subpopulations (domains). The
Complex Estimator can be any analytic function of Horvitz-Thompson or
Calibration estimators.</p></li>
<li><p>svystatTM: now only numeric and factor variables can be
referenced by argument ‘y’. Character variables are no longer allowed
and must be converted to factor in advance, as suggested since the
release of ReGenesees 2.0 (see the NOTE below).</p></li>
<li><p>svystat: the function can now handle calls to svySigma (via kind
= “Sigma”) and svySigma2 (via kind = “Sigma2”). Moreover, specifying
‘by’ when kind = “B” is now allowed, since we do have a ‘by’ argument
for svystatB since ReGenesees 2.1.</p></li>
<li><p>write.svystat: code update to accomodate summary statistics
returned by recent functions svySigma and SvySigma2.</p></li>
<li><p>Improved documentation of how svystatTM works for estimators of
totals and counts (i.e. estimator = “Total”) when interest variables are
affected by missing values and na.rm = TRUE is specified.</p></li>
<li><p>ReGenesees predates the tidyverse, and ReGenesees functions were
not intended to accept in input ‘tibbles’ where data frame had always
been documented to be required. To avoid issues with ‘tibbles’, now
ReGenesees silently converts ‘tibbles’ to plain data frames before
processing them.</p></li>
<li><p>The message that ReGenesees has always printed on screen upon
loading can now be made silent via suppressPackageStartupMessages(). For
Statistics Norway.</p></li>

<h1 class="page-header">
<a href="#regenesees-22" class="anchor"></a>ReGenesees 2.2</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>New function svyDelta: computes estimates and sampling errors of
a Measure of Change from two <em>not necessarily independent</em>
samples. The function handles any <em>complex</em> Measure of Change,
i.e. arbitrary analytic functions of Horvitz-Thompson or Calibration
estimators derived from the two samples. When the two samples are
<em>not independent</em>, sampling covariance terms are properly taken
into account in the estimation of the sampling variance of the Measure
of Change.</p></li>
<li><p>New functions svySigma2 and svySigma: compute estimates and
sampling errors of the Population Variance and Standard Deviation of
numeric variables (in subpopulations too).</p></li>
<li><p>New function smooth.strat.jump: given a stratified one-stage unit
sampling design object, smooths survey weights to cope with estimation
issues that may arise from stratum jumpers.</p></li>
<li><p>New function UWE: computes the Unequal Weighting Effect of design
objects. If the input design is the outcome of a ‘weight-changing
pipeline’, w0 -&gt; w1 -&gt; … -&gt; w, i.e. was obtained by applying an
arbitrary chain of ReGenesees functions that modify the weights
(e.g. smooth.strat.jump, e.calibrate, ext.calibrated, trimcal, …), then
the function computes the UWE of the overall, cumulative weight
adjustment from w0 to w.</p></li>
<li><p>New function pop.plot: draws a scatter plot of calibration
control totals vs current estimates. This plot may provide a
first-level, rough assessment of how hard the calibration problem at
hand will turn out to be in terms of constrained optimization.</p></li>
<li><p>All estimation functions (svystatTM, …, svystatL) now use a
slightly better estimate of design effects for sampling designs that are
not self-weighting (see the added reference to Eurostat’s
Handbook).</p></li>
<li><p>R versions &gt;= 4.2.0 will no longer support 32-bit versions of
Windows, thus memory.limit() is going to disappear. Some ReGenesees
functions, which used the function to improve memory management in low
performance Windows 32-bit environments, have been modified accordingly
(aux.estimates, bounds.hint, e.calibrate, trimcal, and
fill.template.R).</p></li>
<li><p>Function pop.fuse() did not properly handle the corner case in
which the ordinary control totals data frame ‘pop’ derives from a pure
intercept calibration model described as calmodel = ~ 1. Fixed.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed a typo in documentation of ?extractors: confint() example
was wrongly using argument ‘conf.lev’ instead of the right one, ‘level’,
which comes from package stats.</p></li>
</ul>

    <div id="regenesees-21" class="section level1">
<h1 class="page-header">
<a href="#regenesees-21" class="anchor"></a>ReGenesees 2.1</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>This release of ReGenesees introduces support for “Special
Purpose Calibration” tasks, i.e. facilities to calibrate survey weights
so as to match complex, non-linear population parameters, instead of
ordinary population totals.</p></li>
<li><p>NOTE: To date, support is limited to calibration on Multiple
Regression Coefficients, which includes calibration on Means as a
notable special case. Further support will likely be provided in future
extensions.</p></li>
<li>
<p>New functions prep.calBeta and pop.calBeta: prepare survey data
and control totals to run a calibration task on <em>multiple regression
coefficients</em>. These functions enable users to:</p>
<p>(i) Calibrate on regression coefficients of <em>different linear
models</em>, each known at the <em>overall population level</em>.</p>
<p>(ii) Calibrate on regression coefficients of a <em>single linear
model</em>, known possibly for <em>different
subpopulations</em>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>New function pop.fuse: allows to solve jointly a <em>special
purpose calibration</em> task and an <em>ordinary calibration</em> task,
by fusing their respective control totals data frames.</p></li>
<li><p>New method of function pop.desc for class ‘spc.pop’: provides a
natural language description of the control totals dataframes for
“special purpose calibration” tasks. Handles both <em>simple</em> and
<em>fused</em> control totals.</p></li>
<li><p>e.calibrate, check.cal, bounds.hint: code update to cope with
“special purpose calibration” tasks.</p></li>
<li><p>svystatB: added ‘by’ argument. Estimates and sampling errors for
multiple regression coefficients are now available for subpopulations
too. Please have a look at the “Collinearity, Aliasing and Impacts in
Domain Estimation” section of the related help page
(?svystatB).</p></li>
<li><p>write.svystat: code update to accomodate changes induced by new
argument ‘by’ of svystatB.</p></li>
<li><p>trimcal: fixed a bug in internal function ez.trim. The bug only
affected trimmed calibrated objects arising from multi-stage (&gt;=2)
survey designs that had been calibrated asking for constant
within-cluster weights (via argument ‘aggregate.stage’). The bug likely
had a small numerical impact most of the times, with the exception of
variance estimates of calibration control totals. Due to the bug, the
latter did not go (numerically) to zero as they should have done (this
is what led me to detect the bug). Although this is definitely a
non-negligible software consistency issue, fortunately - in real-world
applications - there is no point in estimating the variance of survey
estimates of <em>known</em> population totals.</p></li>
<li><p>e.calibrate, bounds.hint, aux.estimates: equality of
model.formulae was checked with all.equal() (which was a good idea) but
if clauses didn’t use the right construct (i.e. isTRUE(all.equal())).
Fixed.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
    <div id="regenesees-20" class="section level1">
<h1 class="page-header">
<a href="#regenesees-20" class="anchor"></a>ReGenesees 2.0</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>The main purpose of this version is to ensure a safe transition
of ReGenesees to the “R 4.x” series. Indeed R 4.0.0. brought in some
potentially disruptive changes: see, e.g., the following NOTEs.</p></li>
<li><p>NOTE: Under R 4.0.0 or later, old versions of the ReGenesees
package need to be re-installed from sources (i.e. local .tar.gz files).
Binary distributions of old versions (i.e. local .zip files) are
expected not to work under R 4.0.0 or later.</p></li>
<li><p>NOTE: R 4.0.0 changed the default value of argument
‘stringsAsFactors’, which enters functions data.frame(),
as.data.frame(), read.table() and possibly many others. The new default
is now: <em>stringsAsFactors = FALSE</em>. This new behavior has to be
kept in mind when preparing data to be later processed by ReGenesees, as
most ReGenesees functions <em>require</em> categorical variables be
represented as <em>factors</em>. The companion package ReGenesees.GUI
will, of course, keep automatically converting character columns into
factors when importing data from external files.</p></li>
<li><p>ReGenesees is now also available from GITHUB at the following
URL: <a href="https://github.com/DiegoZardetto/ReGenesees" class="uri">https://github.com/DiegoZardetto/ReGenesees</a></p></li>
<li><p>ReGenesees has now a brand new website (built with pkgdown)
hosted on GITHUB pages at the following URL: <a href="https://diegozardetto.github.io/ReGenesees" class="uri">https://diegozardetto.github.io/ReGenesees</a></p></li>
<li><p>e.calibrate, bounds.hint, aux.estimates: now equality of
model.formulae is checked with all.equal() instead of identical(), so
that environment mismatches are neglected. This is desirable when the
model.formulae being compared have been generated within the body of
different functions, but are equal when deparsed.</p></li>
<li><p>estimator.kind: the test that the input statistic ‘stat’ actually
comes from the input ‘design’ object did not work properly in <em>very
special</em> cases (i.e. when ‘stat’ was generated within the body a
function). Fixed.</p></li>
<li><p>svystat: an explicit error message now informs that one cannot
specify ‘by’ nor ‘group’ when kind is ‘B’. This is because svystatB does
not have a ‘by’ argument (see ?svystatB). Fixed.</p></li>
</ul>

    <div id="regenesees-19" class="section level1">
<h1 class="page-header">
<a href="#regenesees-19" class="anchor"></a>ReGenesees 1.9</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>This is a wrap-up release, whose main purpose is to ensure a safe
transition to the “R 3.4.x” series.</p></li>
<li><p>New function trimcal: allows to <em>trim calibration weights</em>
while simultaneously <em>preserving all the calibration
constraints</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>e.calibrate: now the attributes of the output object store more
calibration metadata than before (‘calmodel’, ‘partition’ and
‘aggregate.stage’ have been added). This is intended to benefit
ReGenesees’ new function trimcal.</p></li>
<li><p>cal.estimates: no longer prints on screen to notify that design
object and calibration model formulae (or template) are
coherent.</p></li>
<li><p>e.calibrate: enriched documentation (see ‘Details’ and ‘Examples’
sections) showing how to exploit the ‘sigma2’ argument to prevent some
initial weights from being altered by calibration.</p></li>
<li><p>e.calibrate: error conditions on weights and sigma2 varying
within clusters selected at stage aggregate.stage were raised correctly,
but the example clusters signaled as affected by those errors were not
always the intended ones. Fixed.</p></li>
<li><p>e.svydesign: error condition on self.rep.str varying within
strata was raised correctly, but the example stratum signaled as
affected by that error was not always the intended one. Fixed.</p></li>
<li><p>get.residuals: the ‘Examples’ section of the help has been edited
to fix a cut &amp; paste error (namely ‘WITH’ when ‘WITHOUT’ was
actually intended).</p></li>
<li><p>Package startup messages moved from onLoad to onAttach.</p></li>

    <div id="regenesees-181" class="section level1">
<h1 class="page-header">
<a href="#regenesees-181" class="anchor"></a>ReGenesees 1.8.1</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>This is a patched version, whose main purpose is to ensure a safe
transition to the “R 3.3.x” series.</p></li>
<li><p>Summary method for objects of class ‘analytic’ (and
‘cal.analytic’) is now exported and documented (see ?e.svydesign and
?e.calibrate).</p></li>
<li><p>ext.calibrated: an explicit error message now informs that
<em>negative</em> external calibration weights cannot be handled yet
(see also the related help page ?ext.calibrated).</p></li>
<li><p>bounds.hint: diagnostic object ‘last.hint’ (created into the
.GlobalEnv) now has a ‘call’ attribute only if function bounds.hint gets
called from the command line (i.e. not from ReGenesees.GUI).</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed minor, non-harmful bugs in internal functions as.fpc and
multistage.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
    <div id="regenesees-18" class="section level1">
<h1 class="page-header">
<a href="#regenesees-18" class="anchor"></a>ReGenesees 1.8</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>New function ext.calibrated: enables ReGenesses to digest
calibration weights that have been computed externally (e.g. by other
software), so as to provide correct variance estimates, i.e. appropriate
to calibration estimators.</p></li>
<li><p>New function svystatS: computes estimates and errors for the
shares of a numeric variable held by specific population groups,
possibly within domains. This, incidentally, provides yet another
alternative means to estimate <em>joint</em> relative frequencies within
ReGenesees (see ?svystatTM).</p></li>
<li><p>New function svystatSR: computes estimates and errors for ratios
between shares of a numeric variable held by specific population groups,
possibly within domains.</p></li>
<li><p>New function pop.desc: provides a natural language description of
the structure of known totals dataframes to be used for calibration.
This can be useful to, and has been intended mainly for, users who
cannot exploit function fill.template since they lack a sampling frame
to compute population totals from.</p></li>
<li><p>e.calibrate: now an explicit error message is printed if the
design object undergoing calibration is already calibrated and has
negative weights (i.e. negative calibration weights generated at the
previous calibration step).</p></li>
<li><p>svystatTM: better handling of missing values in estimating
totals. A (very simple) model-based estimator is used now, based on the
MCAR assumption.</p></li>
<li><p>svystatL: I decided to restore the function’s ability to handle
complex estimators whose mathematical expression depends on “parameters”
(i.e. fixed non-random values). This ability is mandatory whenever the
actual values of these parameters cannot be directly typed inside the
call to svystatL by the user (e.g. for batch jobs or
simulations).</p></li>
<li><p>estimator.kind: very elusive (and not harmful) bug found when
argument ‘stat’ was generated by svystat with forGVF = FALSE
<em>and</em> group = NULL. Fixed.</p></li>
<li><p>drop.gvf.points: method for “grouped” models (i.e. objects of
class gvf.fit.gr) had an erroneous default value for argument
‘labels.id’. The only effect of this bug was to attach wrong labels to
alleged outliers: all computations were correct. Fixed.</p></li>
<li><p>predictCV: method for “grouped” models (i.e. objects of class
gvf.fit.gr and gvf.fits.gr) now has the following, useful exception: if
dataframe ‘new.Y’ has just the ‘Y’ column, then CVs will be predicted
for all groups.</p></li>
<li><p>Print method for survey design objects: if first stage fpc is
always zero (or Inf), print on screen ‘(with replacement)’ (as has
always been the case when PSU’s fpc was not specified).</p></li>
<li><p>aux.estimates: do not warn anymore if the names of the dataframes
used to build the design object and the known totals template differ,
whenever the template have been built using the current design
object.</p></li>

<a href="#regenesees-17" class="anchor"></a>ReGenesees 1.7</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>ReGenesees GVF infrastructure - to which I have been working
since ReGenesees version 1.4 - is now complete and fully documented
(hopefully).</p></li>
<li><p>Command citation(“ReGenesees”) gained a new reference, to a paper
which has been recently published by JOS.</p></li>
<li><p>Added new file DESIDERATA in directory inst. It provides a list
of possible ReGenesees extensions I would like to work on. Please, feel
free to send me your ideas on these topics: I would appreciate
it.</p></li>
<li><p>New function svystat: a protean utility to compute many estimates
and errors in just a single shot, primarily to use them in fitting GVF
models. This function can handle estimators of all kinds and is often a
better alternative to function ‘gvf.input’. It also enables fitting
separate GVF models to estimates and errors pertaining to different
population “groups”.</p></li>
<li><p>Utility function estimator.kind and extractor functions SE, VAR,
cv, deff, confint, etc.: extended to handle correctly “grouped” summary
statistics as returned by new function svystat.</p></li>
<li><p>The whole GVF infrastructure has been enriched to cope with one
or more GVF models fitted to “grouped data” (namely, estimates and
errors returned by new function svystat). GVF models are fitted, and
later analysed, separately within each group. All methods available for
older classes gvf.fit and gvf.fits have been extended to new classes for
“grouped” models: gvf.fit.gr and gvf.fits.gr.</p></li>
<li><p>Function drop.gvf.points has been substantially enriched: 1) now
observations to be dropped can be identified by specifying a threshold
for the absolute values of the residuals; 2) both standardized and
studentized residuals can be used; 3) moreover, observations to be
dropped can still be identified interactively by clicking on a plot, but
now both ‘Observed vs Fitted’ and ‘Residuals vs Fitted’ can be
used.</p></li>
<li><p>Added methods rstandard and rstudent for (sets of) fitted GVF
models (see ?gvf.misc for the complete list of currently available
methods).</p></li>
<li><p>GVF.db$insert: very long GVF model formulae would have produced
an error, due to a bad conversion to character: fixed.</p></li>
<li><p>drop.gvf.points: return object mistakenly inherited from the
input object its ‘gvf.input’ attribute instead of its ‘gvf.input.expr’
attribute: luckily this potentially disruptive copy-and-paste generated
bug has been fixed.</p></li>
<li><p>fit.gvf, GVF.db$insert: more checks (both substantive and formal)
have been implemented on passed GVF models.</p></li>
<li><p>Added file index.html in directory inst/doc. This is now linked
from the HTML help entry ‘User guides, package vignettes and other
documentation’.</p></li>
<li><p>When exporting estimated quantiles to text files, function
write.svystat now strips redundant common prefix ‘p =’ in column
‘Probability’.</p></li>
<li><p>Extractor function confint was not behaving correctly on class
svystatQ.by (i.e. for quantiles computed in domains): fixed.</p></li>
<li><p>All error messages raised by passed arguments with wrong classes
now avoid using ‘substitute’: formal arguments bound to erroneous
objects are quoted, instead. This solution is safe even when functions
are not invoked by the command line, but rather by the GUI.</p></li>
<li><p>e.calibrate, bounds.hint: do not warn anymore if the names of the
dataframes used to build the design object and the population totals
differ, whenever the population totals have been built using the current
design object.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>GVF.db is the archive of registered (i.e. built-in and/or
user-defined) Generalized Variance Functions (GVF) models supported by
ReGenesees. Special accessor functions allow to customize, maintain,
extend, update, save and reset such archive.</p></li>
<li><p>New function gvf.input: transforms a set of computed survey
statistics into a suitable (data.frame-like) data structure, in order to
fit a GVF model. A dedicated plot method is provided.</p></li>
<li><p>New utility function estimator.kind: identifies what kind of
estimator has been used to compute a (set of) survey static(s).</p></li>
<li><p>New function fit.gvf: fits one or more GVF models to a set of
survey statistics. Subsetting, printing and summary methods are provided
for (sets of) fitted GVF models. Other available methods for (sets of)
fitted GVF models are listed in ?gvf.misc, namely: coef, residuals,
fitted, predict, effects, anova, and vcov.</p></li>
<li><p>New functions plot.gvf.fit and plot.gvf.fits: provide diagnostics
plots for a single GVF model and plots to compare several GVF models
fitted on the same data.</p></li>
<li><p>New functions drop.gvf.points: enables to interactively drop
outliers by clicking on them on a plot, and simultaneously refits the
GVF model. The change in quality measures (R2, adj. R2, AIC, and BIC)
after re-fitting is printed on screen as a side effect.</p></li>
<li><p>New functions getR2, AIC, BIC: provide quality measures on (sets
of) fitted GVF models.</p></li>
<li><p>New functions getBest: identify the best-fit model among a set of
GVF fitted models according to a given quality criterion.</p></li>
<li><p>New function predictCV: given a set of estimates, predicts their
CV values (and the corresponding confidence or prediction limits) based
on one or more fitted GVF models.</p></li>
<li><p>New data AF.gvf: provides example data (namely, estimates and
sampling errors of Absolute Frequencies) for GVF model fitting.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>New function des.merge: safely merges the original survey data
contained into a design object (even a calibrated one) with new data, by
hinging upon a common key variable. This allows, e.g., to tackle the
task of computing estimates and errors on target variables made
available only after the calibration step, without any need of repeating
the calibration.</p></li>
<li><p>New function get.residuals: computes (scaled) residuals of a set
of interest variables w.r.t. the calibration model adopted to build the
input object. This function has been designed for programmers willing to
build upon ReGenesees (e.g. Istat SMART project team), whereas typical
users are not expected to feel much need of it.</p></li>
<li><p>New ReGenesees option “RG.warn.domain.lonely” (by default FALSE).
If it is set to TRUE, a warning message is raised whenever an estimation
domain happens to contain just a single PSU belonging to a stratum. Note
that this has been the standard ReGenesees behaviour till now.</p></li>
<li><p>e.calibrate: the threshold for triggering ‘program-level’ garbage
collection is now defined as in function fill.template: some efficiency
gain is expected in low resources Windows environments for big
calibration tasks.</p></li>
<li><p>e.calibrate: for unbounded linear calibration a new warning is
printed when, after switching to ginv due to collinearity, the algorithm
does not converge. The suggested alternative is to resort to
Newton-Raphson algorithm by calibrating with very loose bounds,
e.g. bounds=c(-1E12, 1E12).</p></li>
<li><p>e.calibrate: slightly more efficient handling of empty levels
arising from interactions between factors in the calibration
model.</p></li>
<li><p>e.calibrate, collapse.strata: implemented a trick to keep
assigning diagnostic structures into the .GlobalEnv without making ‘R
CMD check’ angry.</p></li>
<li><p>svystatB, svystatL: most essential checks on input type have been
lifted from inner functions to the caller. This should make error
messages easier to understand (mainly for ReGenesees.GUI
users).</p></li>
<li><p>svystatTM: enriched documentation with examples showing how to
estimate totals in domains for “incomplete” partitions, via the AsIs
operator I().</p></li>
<li><p>e.svydesign, bounds.hint, des.addvars: some documentation tidy up
here and there.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>This is essentially a maintenance release, with few user-visible
changes. The major goal was to verify that the transition of ReGenesees
to the “R 3.x” realm would have been safe. To date, everything seems to
be ok.</p></li>
<li><p>I’m currently developing a framework to bring into ReGenesees the
Generalized Variance Functions (GVF) method.</p></li>
<li><p>svystatTM: output object has new attributes “y.vars” and
“by.vars”. These are intended to be used by the forthcoming GVF
infrastructure.</p></li>
<li><p>New utility function Zapsmall: by operating column-wise on
dataframes, puts to zero values “close” to zero.</p></li>
<li><p>e.svydesign: enriched documentation on PPS designs.</p></li>
<li><p>ReGenesees.options: enriched documentation on the Ultimate
Cluster Approximation.</p></li>
<li><p>?data.examples was not working, due to a missing alias in the .Rd
source.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>First release with ByteCompile build: unless something unexpected
is signalled, this will be the standard from now on.</p></li>
<li><p>New function svystatB: computes estimates, standard errors and
confidence intervals for multiple regression coefficients. summary()
method gives p-values and significance codes for the component-wise test
b=0.</p></li>
<li><p>New functions Cov and Corr: compute the design covariance and
correlation between pairs of complex estimators (i.e. any smooth
function of HT or Calibration estimators).</p></li>
<li><p>New function find.lon.strata (originally a private function
intended to be called only by function collapse.strata). It’s a simple,
though maybe sometimes useful, diagnostic tool whose purpose is to
identify the levels of the strata containing lonely PSUs (if
any).</p></li>
<li><p>svystatR, svystatL: when the linearized variable corresponding to
a non linear estimator is ill defined (because the estimator gradient is
singular at the Taylor series expansion point - a typical case is when,
perhaps only inside a single estimation domain, the estimate of the
denominator total in a ratio is zero) an unhandled error was generated
for calibrated designs. This error arises from the fact that Fortran
routine qr.resid cannot cope with NaN, Inf and NA values. Such behaviour
has been fixed: NaN is returned for SE, with a warning, but no errors
(i.e. computation ends normally).</p></li>
<li><p>population.check: a row.names mismatch is now tolerated (under
the hypothesis that everything else is ok).</p></li>
<li><p>vcov: all methods do not warn anymore if only diagonal elements
are present.</p></li>
<li><p>svystatTM, svystatR, e.calibrate: added examples on how to handle
cluster-level variables in estimation and calibration tasks (2-stage
household surveys are a natural playground for such
techniques).</p></li>
<li><p>e.calibrate: added example on how to simultaneously reduce
nonresponse bias and estimators variance with a single calibration
step.</p></li>
<li><p>svystatL: enriched documentation with examples on how to estimate
simple regression coefficients, harmonic and geometric means.</p></li>
<li><p>collapse.strata: enriched documentation with examples providing a
simple way for defining the strata similarity scores, when a strata
clustering has been obtained.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>Better diagnostics on possible Deff anomalies arising from
negative calibrated weights (if any).</p></li>
<li><p>e.svydesign: formulae not referencing survey data variables
(e.g. ids=~1) have been intentionally inhibited (rationale: survey data
is master, formulae are slaves).</p></li>
<li><p>pop.template, population.check, e.calibrate, aux.estimates, …:
partition formula (if any) must reference some survey data variables.
Thus, e.g., partition=~1 has been inhibited. Obviously, a pure intercept
calibration model (i.e. calmodel=~1) remains completely legal.</p></li>
<li><p>e.svydesign, pop.template, fill.template: all functions now check
whether any factor variable in input data has empty levels, and (in
case) drop them.</p></li>
<li><p>e.svydesign: 0 direct weights are now forbidden (formerly, direct
weights were only required to be non negative). A suggestion to people
using ReGenesees infrastructure to build jackknife sampling variance
estimates: substitute illegal 0 direct weights with some negligibly
small cutoff value (e.g. 1E-12).</p></li>
<li><p>ReGenesees now has its own contrasts handling facilities
(i.e. new functions contrasts.RG, contrasts.off and contrasts.reset).
Contrasts can deeply affect the behaviour of several ReGenesees
functions (e.g. e.calibrate, pop.template, fill.template,
aux.estimates), so please read <em>carefully</em> the related help pages
(?contrasts.RG).</p></li>
<li><p>e.calibrate: parameters ‘epsilon’ and ‘force’ are now meaningful
also for unbounded linear calibration (with the same meaning as in all
the remaining cases, for which Newton-Raphson algorithm applies). This
allows to handle possible approximate solutions obtained when switching
to ginv() due to collinearity issues. Note that collinearity is very
likely to manifest whenever you choose to switch-off contrasts (see
?contrasts.RG).</p></li>
<li><p>check.cal, ecal.status, e.calibrate: diagnostics dataframe (which
assesses calibration constraints violation) gains new useful rownames:
for each partition the rownames indicate the position of non-convergence
cells (if any) in population totals dataframe ‘df.population’. Moreover,
diagnostics on calibration results is now richer for unbounded linear
calibration (due to parameter ‘epsilon’, see item above).</p></li>
<li><p>svystatTM, svystatR, svystatQ, svystatL, aux.estimates: now the
return objects of all summary statistics functions carry a “design”
attribute storing the name of the design input object. This way,
computed statistics are almost (namely, excluding possible global
options effects) completely self-documenting.</p></li>
<li><p>ReGenesees now has a (concise) package documentation shell (see
?ReGenesees). I warmly recommend the reading of this shell to new users,
mainly because it provides a ‘quick reading guide’ to the reference
manual, along with a meaningful ‘table of contents’.</p></li>

<li><p>NA handling facilities in summary statistics functions
(svystatTM, svystatR, …) has been completely revised. An elusive bug
entangling NA treatment and lonely PSU treatment (when
lonely.psu=‘average’) has been fixed.</p></li>
<li><p>svystatL did not pass to inner function linearize the na.rm
argument value: fixed.</p></li>
<li><p>Inadvisable (albeit not harmful) code (signalled by Prof Brian
Ripley) has been eliminated from .onLoad.</p></li>
<li><p>Few partial arguments matching in function calls (as signalled by
R CMD CHECK under R 2.15.x) have been removed.</p></li>
<li><p>Further calibration examples added: calibration to soften
nonresponse bias and multi-step calibration.</p></li>
