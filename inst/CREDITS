- ReGenesees owes a lot to the beautiful, rich and still growing
  'survey' package written by Thomas Lumley.
- Retrospectively, the original seeds of the ReGenesees project
  can be traced back to late 2006, when I was trying to optimize
  'survey' in order to enable its critical functions to successfully
  process Istat's large-scale surveys.
- Quite soon, this attempt required me to rethink globally the design
  of the package, i.e. its internal structure at a deeper level.
- Over time, this line of work coagulated into an R package in its own
  right, eventually leading to the first public release of ReGenesees
  in December 2011.
